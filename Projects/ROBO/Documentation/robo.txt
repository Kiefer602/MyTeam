Module "WAIT1"     (component Wait)
   - WAIT1_Wait10Cycles -Wait for 10 CPU cycles.
   - WAIT1_Wait100Cycles -Wait for 100 CPU cycles.
   - WAIT1_WaitCycles -Wait for a specified number of CPU cycles (16bit data type).
   - WAIT1_WaitLongCycles -Wait for a specified number of CPU cycles (32bit data type).

Module "LEDBit1"   (component LED)
   - LEDBit1_Init -Performs the LED driver initialization.
   - LEDBit1_Deinit -Deinitializes the driver
   - LEDBit1_On -This turns the LED on.
   - LEDBit1_Off -This turns the LED off.
   - LEDBit1_Neg -This negates/toggles the LED
   - LEDBit1_Get -This returns logical 1 in case the LED is on, 0 otherwise.
   - LEDBit1_Put -Turns the LED on or off.
   - LEDBit1_SetRatio16 -Method to specify the duty cycle. If using a PWM pin, this means the duty cycle is set. For On/off 
                pins, values smaller 0x7FFF means off, while values greater means on.

Module "LEDBit2"   (component LED)

   - LEDBit2_Neg -This negates/toggles the LED
   - LEDBit2_Get -This returns logical 1 in case the LED is on, 0 otherwise.
   - LEDBit2_Put -Turns the LED on or off.
   - LEDBit2_SetRatio16 -Method to specify the duty cycle. If using a PWM pin, this means the duty cycle is set. For On/off 
                pins, values smaller 0x7FFF means off, while values greater means on.

Module "Bit1"      (component BitIO_LDD)
   - Bit1_Init -Initializes the device. Allocates memory for the device data structure, allocates interrupt vectors and sets 
                interrupt priority, sets pin routing, sets timing, etc. If the "Enable in init. code" is set to "yes" value 
                then the device is also enabled(see the description of the Enable() method). In this case the Enable() method 
                is not necessary and needn't to be generated.
   - Bit1_SetDir -Sets a pin direction (available only if the direction = _[input/output]_).
   - Bit1_SetInput -Sets a pin direction to input (available only if the direction = _[input/output]_).
   - Bit1_GetVal -Returns the input/output value. If the direction is [input] then the input value of the pin is read and 
                returned. If the direction is [output] then the last written value is read and returned (see <Safe mode> 
                property for limitations). This method cannot be disabled if direction is [input].
   - Bit1_PutVal -The specified output value is set. If the direction is <b>input</b>, the component saves the value to a 
                memory or a register and this value will be written to the pin after switching to the output mode (using 
                <tt>SetDir(TRUE)</tt>; see <a href="BitIOProperties.html#SafeMode">Safe mode</a> property for limitations). If 
                the direction is <b>output</b>, it writes the value to the pin. (Method is available only if the direction = 
                <u><tt>output</tt></u> or <u><tt>input/output</tt></u>).
   - Bit1_ClrVal -Clears (set to zero) the output value. It is equivalent to the [PutVal(FALSE)]. This method is available only 
                if the direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_.
   - Bit1_SetVal -Sets (to one) the output value. It is equivalent to the [PutVal(TRUE)]. This method is available only if the 
                direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_.
